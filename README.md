Hi so I had a lot of ideas for my project and I settled on a showcase for a possible game, its an escape game at best but i believe it showcases  the neccessary requirements. 
the code and how i came about to learning how to perform and understand such code is from a playlist by Drew Conley the assets are made by him too 
here is the link to the playlist I watched https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_
all credit for the assets go to him.
